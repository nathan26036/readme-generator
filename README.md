# Readme Generator

The goal is to create a README generator. The user must input the title, the description, their github and other important aspects of a README and then it would generate a formatted README. The license selected must have a banner near the top of the page and the users github link and email are added at the bottom so anyone could reach out easily. There should also be a table of contents that scrolls to each section.

## The process

### What i did
* Included the packages needed for the application
* Created the questions for the user to fill in information for their README
* Created if statements to establish which licenese is being used and to add the banner that is clickable so the user can read more about the license
* Created the format of the README and had it insert the answers from the users answers into it 
* Made working links to the users github and email from the prompts for the questions section so someone could easily reachout
* Created a working table of contents that will scroll down to each section
